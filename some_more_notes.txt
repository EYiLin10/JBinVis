Fileprints: Identifying File Types by n-grame Analysis - Li et. al 2005
-Normalise byte frequency based on file size, rather than frequency of modal byte
-A file is processed to two 256-element vectors (fileprint)
		- one to contain normalised byte frequency, one to contain variance
-Uses Naive Bayes classifier

Oscar -- File Type Identification of Binary Data in Disk Clusters and RAM Pages Karresand and Shahmehri (2006)
-Measure distance between sample vector and centroid using a weighted variant of a quadratic distance
-Weight is the byte's standard deviation (as given by centroid) - larger s.d., then smaller weightage

-Rate of change of bytes (difference between consecutive bytes)
 (can possibly turn this into a histogram)

*** Centroid == average of the vector set (fileprint) for a file type
*** If Distance( fileprint( file input), a centroid ) < threshold, then input file is very likely the
		type of file whose centroid is used in calculation
