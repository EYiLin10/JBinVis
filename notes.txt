JOGL
- Using GLCanvas within JPanel
	1. Ensure JPanel layout is BorderLayout
	2. To allow shrinking of JPanel, on GLEventListener.reshape(), 
	   have to call GLCanvas.setMinimumSize to a predefined minsize
		 -oddly, on reshape, this minimum size changes to reflect the bigger size
		 
Mouse events
-Click event for a component only fires if mouse press and release 
 occur within that same component
-A mouse release is only fired for the component on which initial mouse press
 was fired (but may be released outside the component).
